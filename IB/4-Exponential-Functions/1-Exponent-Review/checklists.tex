\begin{enumerate}
\subsection*{Graphing}

\item Lines must be straight (use a straight edge) and curves smooth (no hard turns)
\item Arrows mark the ends of lines and curves that extend indefinitely. 
\item The endpoints of limited lines and curves are clearly and accurately marked.

\subsection*{Command terms}
Certain instructions have special requirements on IB exam papers.
\item \emph{Write down} indicates the answer is readily visible. No working is required.
\item \emph{Solve} suggests using substitution and algebraic techniques. Show the substitution step explicitly and include a reasonable amount of detail. (Do not drop necessary ``$=0$'' when solving for roots)
\end{enumerate}
