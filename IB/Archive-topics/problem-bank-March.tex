Normal resting blood pressure for an adult is 120 over 80. This means that the blood pressure oscillates between a maximum of 120 and a minimum of 80. Adults with high blood pressure (above 140 over 90) and adults with low blood pressure (below 90 over 60) may be at risk for health disorders. Classify the given patient’s blood pressure as low, normal, or high and explain your reasoning.
